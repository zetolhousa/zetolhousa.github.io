Basically it’s just a doc where you track all that you have done, read, watched, etc.
Your brain being a finite resource can only hold so much information.

FactoryBean An amazing way to instantiate your beans based on different situations or conditions.
Example use case: I want a specific implementation of an interface based on some launch date. I can define that in the factory.
public class MessageFactoryBean implements FactoryBean&lt;MessageInterface> { private MessageInterface postcard; private MessageInterface letter; public MessageInterface getObject() { if (your condition here) { return letter; } return postcard; } // other methods omitted } Where MessageInterface is implemented by PostCard and FormalLetter.&mldr;</div><a class=readmore href=/posts/til-1/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/things-i-wish-i-learnt-before-job/>Things I wish I learnt before getting a job</a></h1><time>Sep 19, 2021</time><br><div class=description>Disclaimer: there is only so much you can prepare in advance.
