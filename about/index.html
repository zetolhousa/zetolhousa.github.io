<meta name=description content="Who am I?
I am a software engineer from Nagaland, India. Currently working in Bengaluru.
Why am I doing this?
A personal blog site has been a long time coming. After 6-7yrs of lying in my todo list it has finally made it. I want to use this blog as documentation for things which I find time to write about and maybe someone may find it useful.
How to get in touch?
