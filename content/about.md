### Who am I?
I am a software engineer from Nagaland, India. Currently working in Bengaluru with Amazon.

### Why am I doing this?
It has been a long time coming. This blog. After 6-7yrs of lying in my todo list. I am not a voracious reader or learner in the traditional sense but I do read and watch a lot of stuff on the internet. Sometimes, on stuff which are not the best use of my time in hindsight. I want to use this blog as documentation for things which I deem are worthy of having read or learned and maybe someone may find it useful.
