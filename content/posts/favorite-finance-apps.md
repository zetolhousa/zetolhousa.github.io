### Bank apps
* The banks own apps to manage accounts. 
* For the purposes of checking statements. Basic banking.

### CRED
* For tracking my credit cards and their due dates so that I don't miss anything.
* It also gives a very nice visual of the statements for the billing cycles. The raw PDFs generated by banks are too unorganized and hard to read.

### INDmoney
* Tracking all my assets and liabilities. All my investments, stocks, EPF, savings and insurances get tracked here.
* It also helps manage your goals and gives a projection of whether and when it will be attained.

### Paytm Money
* This is the main app I use to invest in mutual funds and gold.

### Money Mgr.
* This app is for tracking all my daily expenses and income. I make entries whenever there is a transaction.
* Helps give a bigger picture and spend habits over the weeks or months.

### Kite
* This is where I tried to invest in Indian stocks.
* Not really keeping up though. Managing individual stocks needs dedication. Parking this for now.

### Smallcase
* Just signed up. Seems like a pretty good app. This investment vehicle is like MFs but with more control over the individual equity.
