I was trying to solve this leetcode problem and had to refer the solutions after some minutes attempting it. Then came across this super simple ingenious solution. Took a lot of time trying to wrap my head around it. So I thought I'd just share my thought process was like trying to digest this super simple looking yet miraculous code:

### Max consecutive ones iii

> Note: you'll need basic understanding of what this problem is asking for and may a preliminary very high level overview of the code flow

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = 0

        while right<len(nums):
            if nums[right] == 0:
                k -= 1
            if k<0:
                if nums[left] == 0:
                    k += 1
                left +=1
            right += 1
        return right-left
```

Q. How does left catch up to the next 0 if there are lots of 1 in between without impacting what right is covering?
* Say `1101111001111111` with `k=1`
* The distance covered by `right` is all valid max window up until we go below k when we have to shrink window by increasing `left`. Concern I had was how `left` would even catch up if we increment both `right` and `left` together (`left` never increments alone).
	* Window expands to a max valid and may expand more but will be invalid size
	* Window can then shrink again but it will never go smaller than the max valid attained
* So the logic here is that there is no need for `left` to catch up to close the gap ever gain because it's of no use since the valid max window attained if it grows will only record a bigger window for us. If it shrinks it only shrinks the inflated invalid window size and stops at the valid size.
* This window may move to another spot with invalid 0-1 combinations but that's also not a concern. If there's any bigger valid window then things will fix again.

##### (1)101111(0)01111111: left=0, right=7
* pretty straight foward till this point
* `k` reduces to `k=-1`
* since `k<0` the window from left will have to shrink
    * `left++ => 1`
* end loop with `right++ => 9`

##### 1(1)011110(0)1111111: left=1, right=9
* `k` reduces further to `k=-2`
* `k<0` so `left++ => 2`
* end loop with `right++ => 10`

##### 11(0)111100(1)111111: left=2, right=10
* at this point `k=-2` and `left=2`
* `k<0` and also `nums[left]==0`
	* so `k++ => -1`
	* `left++ => 3`
* end loop with `right++ => 9`

##### 110(1)11100(1)111111: left=3, right=9
* at this point `k=-1`
* `k<0`
	* `left++ => 4`
* end loop with `right++ => 10`

##### 1101(1)11001(1)11111
`left++ => 5` and `right++ => 11`

##### 11011(1)10011(1)1111
`left++ => 6` and `right++ => 12`

##### 110111(1)00111(1)111
`left++ => 7` and `right++ => 13`

##### 1101111(0)01111(1)11
* `k=-1`
* `k<0`
	* `k++ => 0`
	* `left++ => 8`
`left++ => 8` and `right++ => 14`

##### 11011110(0)11111(1)1
* `k=0`
* so no `left` window shrinking, keep expanding on right until below k-quota again
* `right++ => 15`

##### 11011110(0)111111(1)
* `k=0`
* `right++ => 16`
* right is now exhausted and we exit the loop

##### Conclusion
Now we calculate the max window size attained: `right-left` (no +1 since right is an out of boundary index)
