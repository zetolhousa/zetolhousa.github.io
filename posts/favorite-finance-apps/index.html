<meta name=description content="Bank apps

The banks own apps to manage accounts.
For the purposes of checking statements. Basic banking.

CRED

For tracking my credit cards and their due dates so that I don&rsquo;t miss anything.
It also gives a very nice visual of the statements for the billing cycles. The raw PDFs generated by banks are too unorganized and hard to read.

INDmoney

Tracking all my assets and liabilities. All my investments, stocks, EPF, savings and insurances get tracked here.
It also helps manage your goals and gives a projection of whether and when it will be attained.

Paytm Money

This is the main app I use to invest in mutual funds and gold.

Money Mgr.

This app is for tracking all my daily expenses and income. I make entries whenever there is a transaction.
Helps give a bigger picture and spend habits over the weeks or months.

Kite

This is where I tried to invest in Indian stocks.
Not really keeping up though. Managing individual stocks needs dedication. Parking this for now.

Smallcase

Just signed up. Seems like a pretty good app. This investment vehicle is like MFs but with more control over the individual equity.
